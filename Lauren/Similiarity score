# SSIM score is a value between -1 and 1 that measures the structural similarity between two images.
# This code looks at two images of two different stains from the same patient and computes a similiarity score and creates a visualization map. In the map, dark areas represent regions where the images are more similar
# in structure and light areas are where they are less similar.
